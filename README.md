# SMS Message Dialogue Structure Parser
A personal research project on finding the correct connection between text messages.

Our paper and annotation:

Nianwen Xue, **Qishen Su** and Sooyoung Jeong. [Annotating the discourse and dialogue structure of SMS message conversations] (http://aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1720). Proceedings of the 10th Linguistic Annotation Workshop held in conjunction with ACL 2016 (LAW-X 2016).

The project is currently on hiatus, as I'm currently working on my master's thesis.
